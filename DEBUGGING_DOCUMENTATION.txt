2026-01-21: Compilation Fixes
-----------------------------
1. Fixed `lib/models/match_result.dart`:
   - Issue: File was corrupted/incomplete with placeholder comments.
   - Fix: Reconstructed the complete `MatchResult` and `PetFeatureVector` classes, including the missing `cosineSimilarity` method.

2. Fixed `lib/screens/cctv_camera_screen.dart`:
   - Issue: Syntax errors due to accidental markdown backticks at the end of the file and unused imports.
   - Fix: Removed markdown artifacts and unnecessary imports.

3. Fixed `lib/screens/test_detector_screen.dart`:
   - Issue: Type mismatch error. `_detections` was declared as `List<Map<...>>` but `_detector.detect()` returns `List<AIDetectionResult>`.
   - Fix: Updated `_detections` to `List<AIDetectionResult>` and corrected property access (e.g., `det['label']` -> `det.label`).

4. Fixed `lib/widgets/ai_overlay_widget.dart` and `lib/widgets/pet_card_widget.dart`:
   - Issue: Undefined property `breed` on `BreedInfo` class.
   - Fix: Changed property access from `.breed` to `.breedName` to match the `BreedInfo` class definition.

5. Fixed `lib/screens/public/adoption_list_screen.dart`:
   - Issue: 'Target of URI doesn't exist' and 'Undefined class' errors.
   - Fix: Corrected relative import paths (changed `../models/...` to `../../models/...`).

6. Fixed `android/build.gradle.kts`:
   - Issue: "Unresolved reference: android" and "Too many characters in a character literal" errors.
   - Cause: The `android { ... }` configuration block was incorrectly placed in the root project's build file. It belongs in the app module's build file.
   - Fix: Removed the invalid `android { ... }` block from `android/build.gradle.kts`. Verified that `android/app/build.gradle.kts` already contains the correct configuration.

Status: All reported compilation errors have been resolved. The app should now compile and run.
